<!-- Your competitor, MovieCo, has an open API which allows you to see their last 10,000 rentals. In order to get a competitive advantage, your job is to write some code to analyze that data and spot trends.
The API is available at two endpoints:
* http://159.203.175.239:8080/movies.txt
Contains all of the movies in the format
	ID Title (Year)
Example
	111 Good Will Hunting (1997)
	(The movie "Good Will Hunting" from 1997 has id 111)
* http://159.203.175.239:8080/checkouts.txt
Contains the last 12 months of checkouts in the format
	userID Month MovieID
Example
	user95 jun 83
	(The user #95 checked out movie #83 in June)
	Each record in checkouts.txt records one instance of one movie being checked out by one user.
Your job is to write code to answer the following questions:
1. What user had the most checkouts in the last 12 months?
2. What month had the most checkouts in the last 12 months?
3. What is the title of the movie that was the most checked out in the last 12 months

/*this is useful:
procedure mode()
   
   Array A
   
   FOR EACH value i in A DO
      
      Set Count to 0
      
      FOR j FROM 0 to i DO
         IF A[i] = A[j]
            Increment Count
         END IF
      END FOR
      
      IF Count > MaxCount
         MaxCount =  Count
         Value    =  A[i]
      END IF
   
   END FOR 
      
   DISPLAY Value as Mode
   
end procedure 
from: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/learn_c_by_examples/mode_program_in_c.htm  I should look for more pseudocode regardless of language.
